          <h3>Software Development</h3>
          <p>After several years as a hardware engineer and several diverse roles in software, I found
            myself attracted to code programing. I like to play with data, find what hide behind the numbers.
            Also I like to build apps, games and create anything that I can think of.
            Been a software Developer is a great gift, nothing is impossible,
            everything is in front of your finger tips.</p>

          <h3>Continuous Learning & Development</h3>
          <p>I love to study new areas that interest me. I take courses on several
             topics like: Machine Learning, Data Science and obviosly Python Programming.
             I think that learning is the way to keep the mind sharp and ticking</p>
